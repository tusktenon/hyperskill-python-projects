# Bill Splitter

## Project description

Eating out with friends is fun, but splitting the bill can be tricky. This project helps you develop a Python-based tool to easily divide restaurant bills equally. Input the number of friends and the total bill amount, and the app calculates each person's share. No more awkward calculations or uneven splits!
