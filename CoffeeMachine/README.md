# Coffee Machine (Python)

## Project description

What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how to do it. In this project, you will work on programming a coffee machine simulator. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino, and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money.

## Stage 1/6: Making coffee

### Description

Let's start with a program that makes you a coffee – virtual coffee, of course. In this project, you will implement functionality that simulates a real coffee machine. It can run out of ingredients, such as milk or coffee beans, it can offer you various types of coffee, and, finally, it will take money for the prepared drink.

### Objective

The first version of the program just makes you a coffee. It should print to the standard output what it is doing as it makes the drink.

### Example

Take a look at the sample output below and print all the following lines.

Output:
```text
Starting to make a coffee
Grinding coffee beans
Boiling water
Mixing boiled water with crushed coffee beans
Pouring coffee into the cup
Pouring some milk into the cup
Coffee is ready!
```


## Stage 2/6: Ingredient calculator

### Description

Now let's consider a case when you need a lot of coffee. Maybe you're hosting a party with a lot of guests! In these circumstances, it's better to make preparations in advance.

So, we will ask a user to enter the desired amount of coffee, in cups. Given this, you can adjust the program by calculating how much water, coffee, and milk are necessary to make the specified amount of coffee.

Of course, all this coffee is not needed *right* now, so at this stage, the coffee machine doesn't actually make any coffee yet.

### Objectives

Let's break the task into several steps:

1. First, read the numbers of coffee drinks from the input.
2. Figure out how much of each ingredient the machine will need. Note that one cup of coffee made on this coffee machine contains *200 ml* of water, *50 ml* of milk, and *15 g* of coffee beans.
3. Output the required ingredient amounts back to the user.

### Examples

The greater-than symbol followed by a space (`> `) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

**Example 1:** *a dialogue with a user might look like this*
```text
Write how many cups of coffee you will need:
> 25
For 25 cups of coffee you will need:
5000 ml of water
1250 ml of milk
375 g of coffee beans
```

**Example 2:** *here is another dialogue*
```text
Write how many cups of coffee you will need:
> 125
For 125 cups of coffee you will need:
25000 ml of water
6250 ml of milk
1875 g of coffee beans
```
