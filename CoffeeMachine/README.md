# Coffee Machine (Python)

## Project description

What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how to do it. In this project, you will work on programming a coffee machine simulator. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino, and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money.

## Stage 1/6: Making coffee

### Description

Let's start with a program that makes you a coffee – virtual coffee, of course. In this project, you will implement functionality that simulates a real coffee machine. It can run out of ingredients, such as milk or coffee beans, it can offer you various types of coffee, and, finally, it will take money for the prepared drink.

### Objective

The first version of the program just makes you a coffee. It should print to the standard output what it is doing as it makes the drink.

### Example

Take a look at the sample output below and print all the following lines.

Output:
```text
Starting to make a coffee
Grinding coffee beans
Boiling water
Mixing boiled water with crushed coffee beans
Pouring coffee into the cup
Pouring some milk into the cup
Coffee is ready!
```


## Stage 2/6: Ingredient calculator

### Description

Now let's consider a case when you need a lot of coffee. Maybe you're hosting a party with a lot of guests! In these circumstances, it's better to make preparations in advance.

So, we will ask a user to enter the desired amount of coffee, in cups. Given this, you can adjust the program by calculating how much water, coffee, and milk are necessary to make the specified amount of coffee.

Of course, all this coffee is not needed *right* now, so at this stage, the coffee machine doesn't actually make any coffee yet.

### Objectives

Let's break the task into several steps:

1. First, read the numbers of coffee drinks from the input.
2. Figure out how much of each ingredient the machine will need. Note that one cup of coffee made on this coffee machine contains *200 ml* of water, *50 ml* of milk, and *15 g* of coffee beans.
3. Output the required ingredient amounts back to the user.

### Examples

The greater-than symbol followed by a space (`> `) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

**Example 1:** *a dialogue with a user might look like this*
```text
Write how many cups of coffee you will need:
> 25
For 25 cups of coffee you will need:
5000 ml of water
1250 ml of milk
375 g of coffee beans
```

**Example 2:** *here is another dialogue*
```text
Write how many cups of coffee you will need:
> 125
For 125 cups of coffee you will need:
25000 ml of water
6250 ml of milk
1875 g of coffee beans
```


## Stage 3/6: Estimate the number of servings

### Description

A real coffee machine doesn't have an infinite supply of water, milk, or coffee beans. And if you input a really big number, it's almost certain that a real coffee machine wouldn't have the supplies needed to make all that coffee for you.

In this stage, you need to improve the previous program. Now you will check amounts of water, milk, and coffee beans available in your coffee machine at the moment.

### Objectives

Write a program that does the following:

1. It requests the amounts of water, milk, and coffee beans available at the moment, and then asks for the number of cups a user needs.

2. If the coffee machine has enough supplies to make the specified amount of coffee, the program should print `"Yes, I can make that amount of coffee"`.

3. If the coffee machine can make more than that, the program should output `"Yes, I can make that amount of coffee (and even N more than that)"`, where *N* is the number of additional cups of coffee that the coffee machine can make.

4. If the amount of given resources is not enough to make the specified amount of coffee, the program should output `"No, I can make only N cups of coffee"`.

Like in the previous stage, the coffee machine needs *200 ml* of water, *50 ml* of milk, and *15 g* of coffee beans to make one cup of coffee.

### Examples

The greater-than symbol followed by a space (`> `) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

**Example 1:**
```text
Write how many ml of water the coffee machine has:
> 300
Write how many ml of milk the coffee machine has:
> 65
Write how many grams of coffee beans the coffee machine has:
> 100
Write how many cups of coffee you will need:
> 1
Yes, I can make that amount of coffee
```

**Example 2:**
```text
Write how many ml of water the coffee machine has:
> 500
Write how many ml of milk the coffee machine has:
> 250
Write how many grams of coffee beans the coffee machine has:
> 200
Write how many cups of coffee you will need:
> 10
No, I can make only 2 cups of coffee
```

**Example 3:**
```text
Write how many ml of water the coffee machine has:
> 1550
Write how many ml of milk the coffee machine has:
> 299
Write how many grams of coffee beans the coffee machine has:
> 300
Write how many cups of coffee you will need:
> 3
Yes, I can make that amount of coffee (and even 2 more than that)
```

**Example 4:**
```text
Write how many ml of water the coffee machine has:
> 0
Write how many ml of milk the coffee machine has:
> 0
Write how many grams of coffee beans the coffee machine has:
> 0
Write how many cups of coffee you will need:
> 1
No, I can make only 0 cups of coffee
```

**Example 5:**
```text
Write how many ml of water the coffee machine has:
> 0
Write how many ml of milk the coffee machine has:
> 0
Write how many grams of coffee beans the coffee machine has:
> 0
Write how many cups of coffee you will need:
> 0
Yes, I can make that amount of coffee 
```

**Example 6:**
```text
Write how many ml of water the coffee machine has:
> 200
Write how many ml of milk the coffee machine has:
> 50
Write how many grams of coffee beans the coffee machine has:
> 15
Write how many cups of coffee you will need:
> 0
Yes, I can make that amount of coffee (and even 1 more than that)
```
