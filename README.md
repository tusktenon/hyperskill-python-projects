# Hyperskill Python Projects

These are the projects I completed as part of the [Python Core](https://hyperskill.org/courses/22) course on [Hyperskill](https://hyperskill.org).


## The Projects

**12 Days of Coding** is a daily programming challenge event that ran from December 25, 2025 to January 5, 2026. It isn't part of a Python course, and in fact, the problems can be solved in the language of your choice, but I used Python for my solutions. The puzzles are interesting, often variants on classic problems and algorithms (the Seven Bridges of Königsberg, the eight queens puzzle, longest common substring, Dijkstra's algorithm, the critical path method, etc.), and the solutions certainly showcase Python's clarity and brevity. Note that there are really only 11 days (the 12th day was for user feedback).
