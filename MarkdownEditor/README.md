# Markdown Editor

## Project description

Markdown is a special plain text formatting language that is extremely popular among developers. It is used in documents, research articles, Github README files, and other things. In this project, you will write an editor that will be able to recognize several tags, structures, and save your results to a file. You will practice concepts frequently tested in technical interviews at top tech companies.

## Stage 1/5: Meet the markdown!

### Description

Welcome to the first stage of the project!

If you have worked with the markdown, you will probably recognize the following syntax:
```text
# The Beatles
One may say that they were the most famous **rock band** ever.
The legendary **line-up** comprised the following people:
* *John Lennon*
* *Paul McCartney*
* *George Harrison*
* *Ringo Starr*
```

Yes! It is a raw markdown code. It translates into:

### Objectives

Print the source (raw) markdown code of the markdown snippet below. Show your understanding of the syntax basics. You can use [the Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) as it covers all the necessary topics.

Below is the snippet to complete this stage. Here you can see such elements as the **heading**, the **italicized** text, the **strikethrough** text, the text both **italicized** and **bold** (you can surround it with triple `*` on each end, for instance: `***Lennon***`), and an **unordered list**. Once you write the snippet in the markdown syntax, put it into triple quotes and print it:

### Example

Take a look at the snippet below. This example is for reference only.

To reconstruct the snippet's structure with markdown, you would have needed to print the following:
```text
# The List of Albums
During their history, a lot of great albums were released.
These are my favorite:
1. Abbey Road
2. Rubber Soul
3. Revolver
4. A Hard Day's Night
```
