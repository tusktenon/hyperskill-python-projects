# On The Ninth Day Of Coding...

[View on Hyperskill](https://hyperskill.org/learn/daily/53350)

*On the ninth day of coding my team lead sent to me... Nine cat lives,*

*Eight queens, seven Bridges of Königsberg,*

*Six handshakes, five-pointed star, four dining elves, three security rules, two pointers, and a nasty bug in a production tree!*

Mr. Frost rushes in looking worried. "We have a situation. One of our delivery cats needs to cross the warehouse district to deliver an urgent package. The district is a 20×20 grid, and each cell has a hazard level from 0 to 3. Every time the cat passes through a cell, it loses lives equal to that cell's hazard level."

He pulls up a map. "The cat starts at the top-left corner and needs to reach the bottom-right corner. It can move up, down, left, or right - one cell at a time. The cat has 9 lives total. Find the safest path - the one that costs the fewest lives."

**Input format:** 20 lines, each containing 20 comma-separated numbers (0-3) representing hazard levels

**Output:** The minimum number of lives lost on the optimal path from top-left (0,0) to bottom-right (19,19)

This problem requires finding the "cheapest" path through a grid. There are several ways to do that. Here are some ideas to do it efficiently:

- Keep track of the minimum cost to reach each cell;
- Among all cells you can currently reach, always explore the one with the lowest total cost first;
- When you visit a cell, check its 4 neighbors (up/down/left/right). Calculate: `new_cost = current_cost + neighbor's hazard_level`. If this is cheaper than any previous way to reach that neighbor, update it.

You might want to use a heap or [priority queue](https://hyperskill.org/learn/step/27342). Here's a [related article that might help you](https://hyperskill.org/learn/step/5772).
