# On The Third Day Of Coding...

*On the third day of coding my team lead sent to me... Three security rules,*

*Two pointers, and a nasty bug in a production tree!*

Mr. Frost is quite sad today. The reindeer system got hacked. Apparently, Rudolph had `rednose` set as his password. Was not hard to break at all! The cybersecurity team developed a new system where each reindeer has to come up with 50 different passwords, out of which the tech team will choose the best one on a set of three rules.

Oh, and by "the tech team" they mean **you**. Good luck!

**Input:** list of 50 passwords chosen by reindeer, each on a new line
**Output:** A password with the highest security score based on three rules. In case of ties, the earlier password in the file takes precedence.

**The three rules:**

1. Base password security score is its length.

2. Every password should have at least: one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one digit, one special symbol (`!@#$%^&*`). If any of these categories are missing, multiply base score by `0.75` for each missing category.

3. Every password should minimize repeated characters. If at least 30% of password consists of the same character, subtract the number of occurrences of that character from the score (applied only to the most frequent character).

**Rules are applied sequentially.**
