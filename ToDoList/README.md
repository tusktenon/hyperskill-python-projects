## Stage 1/4: Plan it!

### Description

Do you have 10 minutes a day to add an extra $4000 to your monthly income?

This is the difference between people who write down their goals and those who don’t. That’s one of many reasons why having a To-Do list can improve your work and personal life. You can use it to reduce stress in your life and be more productive. It also helps you become more persistent and save time for the best things in your life.

In this project, you will create a to-do list that will help you organize your life.

### Objectives

To begin with, develop a simple list that contains four tasks. Your program must print the list in the example.

### Example

The greater-than symbol followed by a space (`> `) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

**Example 1:** *a list for your program*
```text
Today:
1) Do yoga
2) Make a breakfast
3) Learn the basics of SQL
4) Learn about ORM
```


## Stage 2/4: Accumulate it!

### Description

It's not good that when you close the to-do list application, the tasks disappear. To avoid this, you need to create a database where you can store all information about your tasks. We will use **SQLite** to create a database and **SQLAlchemy** to manage the database from Python.

First, you need to create a database file. To create it, use the `create_engine()` method, where `file_name` is the database file name:
```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

engine = create_engine('sqlite:///file_name?check_same_thread=False')
```

The `check_same_thread=False` argument connects a database from another thread. Please, set it as described, as the tests require it. Otherwise, you will get an exception.

Once you've created your database file, you need to create a table inside. First, create a **model class** that describes the table in the database. Consider a piece of code below when doing it:
```python
class Table(Base):
    ...
    string_field = Column(String, default='default_value')
    date_field = Column(Date, default=datetime.today())

    def __repr__(self):
        return self.string_field
```

- `string_field` is a string column; `default='default_value'` indicates that the default value of this column is `default_value`;
- `date_field` is a column that stores the date. SQLAlchemy automatically converts the SQL `date` into a Python `datetime` object;
- The `__repr__` method returns a string representation of the class object. In the ORM concept, each row in the table is an object of a class.

Once you are done with the table description, you need to add it to the database. This will create a table in the database by generating SQL queries according to the described models. Now, we can access the database. To do this, create a session.

The `session` object is the only thing you need to manage the database. This is how you can create a new row in the table:
```python
new_row = Table(string_field='This is a string field!',
         date_field=datetime.strptime('01-24-2020', '%m-%d-%Y').date())
```

To get all rows from the table, you can pass the model class to the `query()` method that selects all rows from the table represented by a model class:
```python
rows = session.query(Table).all()
```

The `all()` method returns all rows from the table as a Python list. Each element of this list is an object of the model class. You can access the row fields by their names:
```python
first_row = rows[0] # In case rows list is not empty

print(first_row.string_field) # Will print the value of the string_field
print(first_row.id) # Will print the id of the row
print(first_row) # Will print the string that was returned by the __repr__ method
```

### Objectives

To complete this stage, you need to arrange the data storage in the database. Here's what you need to do:

1. Create a database file. Name it as `todo.db`;
2. Create a table in this database. Name it as `task`.

The table `task` should have the following columns:

- An integer column named `id`. Arrange it as the primary key;
- A string column named `task`;
- A date column named `deadline`. It should have the date when the task was created by default. You can use the `datetime.today()` method.

Also, you need to implement a menu that will make your program more convenient. The menu should have the following items:

1. `Today's tasks`. It prints all the tasks for today;
2. `Add a task`. It asks for task descriptions and saves them in the database;
3. `Exit`.

### Example

The greater-than symbol followed by a space (`> `) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

```text
1) Today's tasks
2) Add a task
0) Exit
> 1

Today:
Nothing to do!

1) Today's tasks
2) Add a task
0) Exit
> 2

Enter a task
> Prepare a presentation
The task has been added!

1) Today's tasks
2) Add a task
0) Exit
> 1

Today:
1. Prepare a presentation

1) Today's tasks
2) Add a task
0) Exit
> 0

Bye!
```
