Welcome to a fun project that takes us back to the '80s and the world of ASCII characters. If you have ever been tasked with drawing a Christmas tree using asterisks in your programming journey, this project is for you. Drawing an entire Christmas card will make the task a bit more challenging. Get ready to have some fun!
