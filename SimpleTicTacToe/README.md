# Simple Tic-Tac-Toe with Python

## Project description

Everybody remembers this paper-and-pencil game from childhood: Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. A single mistake usually costs you the game, but thankfully it is simple enough that most players discover the best strategy quickly. Let’s program Tic-Tac-Toe and get playing!

## Stage 1/5: Welcome to the battlefield!

### Description

**Tic-tac-toe** is a game known all over the world. Each country may have its own version of the name, sometimes the rules are different, but the essence of the game remains the same. Below are the main rules that may be familiar to you since childhood.

Tic-tac-toe is played by two players on a 3x3 grid. One of the players is 'X', and the other player is 'O'. X plays first, then O takes the next turn, and so on.

The players write 'X' and 'O' on a 3x3 field.

The first player that puts 3 X's or 3 O's in a straight line (including diagonals) wins the game.

### Objectives

Your first task in this project is to print the game grid in the console output. Use what you've learned about the `print()` function to print three lines, each containing three characters (X's and O's) to represent a game of tic-tac-toe where all fields of the grid have been filled in.

### Example

The example below shows how your output might look:
```text
X O X
O X O
X X O 
```

**Note:** for-loop should be used in this task.


## Stage 2/5: The user is the gamemaster

### Description

Our program should be able to display the grid at all stages of the game. Now we're going to write a program that allows the user to enter a string representing the game state and correctly prints the 3x3 game grid based on this input. We'll also add some boundaries around the game grid.

### Objectives

In this stage, you will write a program that:

1. Reads a string of 9 symbols from the input and displays them to the user in a 3x3 grid. The grid can contain only `X`, `O` and `_` symbols.

2. Outputs a line of dashes `---------` above and below the grid, adds a pipe `|` symbol to the beginning and end of each line of the grid, and adds a space between all characters in the grid. 

### Examples

The greater-than symbol followed by a space (`> `) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

**Example 1:**
```text
> O_OXXO_XX
---------
| O _ O |
| X X O |
| _ X X |
---------
```

**Example 2:**
```text
> OXO__X_OX
---------
| O X O |
| _ _ X |
| _ O X |
---------
```

**Example 3:**
```text
> _XO__X___
---------
| _ X O |
| _ _ X |
| _ _ _ |
---------
```

**Note:** try to convert string to a list of lists, then iterate through the grid and apply the consistent formatting (borders and spaces).
