## Stage 1/4: What's on the menu?

### Description

Create a menu for your program and ask users what to do. If users select to end the program, quit with a farewell message.

### Objectives

Let's break the task into several steps:

- Create the `MAIN MENU`, `CRUD MENU`, and the `TOP TEN MENU`;
- Display the `MAIN MENU`;
- Ask for an option: `Enter an option:`;
- Display the selected menu;
- Ask for an option: `Enter an option:`;
- When a valid option is selected, print `Not implemented!`;
- When an invalid option is selected, print `Invalid option!`;
- Quit with a farewell message: `Have a nice day!`;

The code snippets below show the menus:

```text
MAIN MENU
0 Exit
1 CRUD operations
2 Show top ten companies by criteria
```

```text
CRUD MENU
0 Back
1 Create a company
2 Read a company
3 Update a company
4 Delete a company
5 List all companies
```

```text
TOP TEN MENU
0 Back
1 List by ND/EBITDA
2 List by ROE
3 List by ROA
```

### Examples

The greater-than symbol followed by a space (`> `) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

**Example 1:**
```text

## Stage 2/4: Store it

### Description

A **database** is an organized collection of data, typically stored electronically in a computer system.

Let's create a database. In this stage, your program will read the files and create a database with them. Follow the objectives and examples to improve your program.

[companies.csv](https://cogniterra.org/media/attachments/lesson/26667/companies.csv)

[financial.csv](https://cogniterra.org/media/attachments/lesson/26667/financial.csv)

### Objectives

Let's break the task into several steps:

- Read the data from *test/companies.csv* and *test/financial.csv*;
- Replace the empty values with `None`;
- Create an SQLite database — *investor.db*;
- Create the `companies` table;
- Create the `financial` table;
- Insert datasets to the tables;
- End the program with a message: `Database created successfully!`;

The snippet below shows the detail of the `companies` model. Please don't change the terms and types.
```text
ticker: String, primary_key
name: String
sector: String
```

The snippet below shows the details of the `financial` model. Please don't change the terms and types.
```text
ticker: String, primary_key
ebitda: Float
sales: Float
net_profit: Float
market_price: Float
net_debt: Float
assets: Float
equity: Float
cash_equivalents: Float
liabilities: Float
```

### Example

The greater-than symbol followed by a space (`> `) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.
```text
Database created successfully!
```


## Stage 3/4: Talking numbers

### Description

Keep the functionality from the former steps and implement CRUD MENU. Your program will create an item, read it, update it, and delete an item in the database.

[companies.csv](https://cogniterra.org/media/attachments/lesson/26667/companies.csv)

[financial.csv](https://cogniterra.org/media/attachments/lesson/26667/financial.csv)
